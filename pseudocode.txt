- Read in the coordinates using "with open() as f"
    - Split the data by line

- Iterate through each line and separate the coordinates into lists 

- Define the number of holes desired along the x-axis

- Find the x-coordinates of the holes

- Define the common z-coordinate
    - Define fraction
    - Index the z-coordinates by the fraction of number of z-values

- Find the y-coordinates corresponding to the x-values and the common z-value

- Take either the top or bottom y-coordinate value (determined by the x-coordinate and the z-coordinate) as the common value
    - Either the larger y-value will be the pressure side or the suction side of the blade

- Create a new .csv File and write the coordinates to that file
    - This file will be used as the injection regions csv
