- Import Pandas

- Read csv file using .read_csv() method into a dataframe

- Define the number of holes desired along the x-axis

- Find the x-coordinates of the holes

- Define the common y-coordinate
    - Define fraction
    - Index the y-coordinates by the fraction of number of y-values

- Find the z-coordinates corresponding to the x-values and the common y-value

- Take either the top or bottom z-coordinate value (determined by the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate) as the common value
    - Either the larger z-value will be the pressure side or the suction side of the blade

- Create a new .csv File and write the coordinates to that file
