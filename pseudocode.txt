- Read in the coordinates using "with open() as f"
    - Split the data by line

- Iterate through each line and separate the coordinates into lists 

- Add each coordinate and its corresponding index to dictionaries

- Define the number of holes in a row and the interval of coordinates between them

- Sort the z-values of the z-dictionary in ascending order

- Find the middle z index

- Find the minimum and maximum indices

- Find the z-coordinates given by the indices (should be separated by the defined interval)

- Iterate through the z-points
    - Find the x- and y-coordinates that correspond to each z-point

- Create a new .csv File and write the coordinates to that file
    - This file will be used as the injection regions csv
